Star of David or star of Israel's false god Remphan mentioned in Acts 7:43?\n\nIn his final sermon before he was martyred, Stephen recited the history of rebellious Israel. Referring to the idolatry of the ancient Israelites, Stephen mentioned the god Molech and \u201cthe star of your god Rephan\u201d (Acts 7:43). Other versions of the Bible spell the name of the false god as Remphan (KJV, NKJV) or Rompha (NASB, AMP). They are all talking about the same false god.\n\nIn the context of Stephen\u2019s reference to \u201cthe star of your god Rephan,\u201d he mentions the golden calf that Israel worshiped at Sinai (Acts 7:39\u201341). He then says that \u201cGod turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars\u201d (verse 42). One of those \u201cstars\u201d they worshiped was the star of Remphan (verse 43). Finally, Stephen points to God\u2019s determination to send Israel into exile in Babylon (verse 43). Stephen\u2019s argument before the Sanhedrin was that the current generation of Israel was just as \u201cstiff-necked\u201d as their ancestors, \u201calways resist[ing] the Holy Spirit!\u201d (verse 51). They had proved their stubbornness in their rejection of Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen he referred to the \u201cstar of your god Rephan,\u201d Stephen was quoting the Greek translation of the Old Testament Scriptures known as the Septuagint, or LXX. This translation by Hebrew scholars was completed about the third century BC. The passage Stephan quotes is Amos 5:26, which in an English translation of the LXX reads, \u201cYea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Raephan, the images of them which ye made for yourselves\u201d (tr. by Sir Lancelot Brenton, 1851).\n\nIn the Hebrew text of Amos 5:26, the name the LXX translates as \u201cRaephan\u201d is Kiyun, spelled Chiun (KJV), Kaiwan (NLT, CSB), or Kiyyun (ESV), depending on the Bible version. Some versions, such as the NIV, do not transliterate the word at all.\n\nThe International Standard Bible Encyclopedia identifies Rephan as \u201cthe Babylonian name for the god of the planet Saturn.\u201d The International Standard Bible translates Amos 5:26 as \u201cAnd you carried the tent of your king\u2014and Saturn, your star god idols that you crafted for yourselves.\u201d Smith\u2019s Bible Dictionary and Easton\u2019s Bible Dictionary also link Rephan (or Remphan) to the god Saturn.\n\nIt seems the Babylonians worshiped a god of their own imagination and named him \u201cKiyun,\u201d whose place in the heavens was as a \u201cwandering star\u201d that they also named \u201cKiyun\u201d after their god. All the ancient peoples had observed that some stars\u2014in actuality planets\u2014moved through the sky, while other stars\u2014the genuine stars\u2014were fixed. (The Greek term asteres plan\u0113tai, shortened to just plan\u0113tai, meant \u201cwandering stars.\u201d) The ancients made no distinction between stars and planets; to them, they were all stars of some type. Thus, Saturn was considered a \u201cstar,\u201d and the deity associated with him was a \u201cstar-god.\u201d\n\nThe god Kiyun was worshiped among the ancient Babylonians, Arabs, Syrians, and Assyrians. Every false god had its representation, its idol. Molech was represented by a brass bull; Astarte by a tree; Dagon by a half-man, half-fish; and Kiyun by a star\u2014the wandering \u201cstar\u201d we know as the planet Saturn.\n\nIn short, \u201cthe star of your god Rephan\u201d mentioned in Acts 7:43 is a pagan god that some ancient Israelites unwisely worshiped in the wilderness. The name Rephan is an English translation of the LXX translation of the Hebrew word Kiyun.\n\nMany some theorizes, the star of Remphan represented the Jews who rejected the Holy Spirit of God and worshiped an false god. The citizens of the country named Israel today also rejected the Holy Spirit of God and rebel against God leaving the six-pointed Star of David featured on the Jewish flag to represent that same rebellion against the Holy Spirit today.", "ocr": "", "image": ["src/hmama/train/reddit_images\\1nnnar5.jpg"], "label": 0}

These dark occultists operate via deception and manipulation. Debunking the horned hand sign and its hidden meanings. Many are being falsely misled into believing it means \u201cI love you humanity\u201d, which is not the case at all. That\u2019s just want they want people to think. These dark occultists operate via deception and manipulation, we must be aware of how they operate to better protect others and no longer be deceived by the narratives they want humanity to think. When humanity realises how the language of symbolism operates, a huge awakening and shift will occur. Hidden in plain sight symbolism is how those apart of cults operate. Basically they\u2019re telling us, without telling us who they are. They always speak in code, telling us who they\u2019re in allegiance with via symbols, signs, numbers, colours etc the list goes on. They also use such hand signs to cast spells on people. \n\nHorned Hand or The Mano Cornuto\n\n\u201cThe two fingers pointing upwards represent the horns of Satan. This sign can be made in the following ways:\n -With the index and the pinkie fingers raised, and the thumb over the folded middle and ring fingers. The thumb over the fingers is the Satanic salute in occultism. It is a sign of recognition between those who are in the occult. When pointed at someone, it means to cast a spell. This sign is made with the left hand. Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and author of the Satanic Bible, was constantly throwing this hand gesture. On the back of his Bible, there is a picture of him doing it with his left hand. The following is an excerpt from what he wrote in his Satanic Bible: \"...This gesture is the Satanic salute, a sign of recognition between and allegiance of members of Satanism or other unholy groups. I love you Satan.\"\n\n\u2014With the index and the pinkie pointing up, the middle and ring fingers folded and the thumb extended. This signifies I love you Satan.\nIn American Sign Language, this hand sign made with an extended thumb, is the muted sign for the phrase \"I love you (ILY)\". It was created by Helen Keller (1880-1968), a practicing occultist and theosophist. Helena Blavatsky, who founded the Theosophical Society, was a 32\u00b0 Freemason and a devout Satan worshipper who was an enemy of Christ. She is also one of the pioneers of today's occult New Age Movement. She wrote in her book 'Lucifer A Theosophical Magazine':\n* \"Lucifer represents.. Life.. Thought.. Progress.. Civilization.. Liberty.. Independence.. Lucifer is the Logos.. the Serpent, the Savior.\" |Pages 171, 225, 255 (Volume II)|\n* \"It is Satan who is the God of our planet and the only God.\" |pages 215, 216, 220, 245, 255, 533, (VI)|\n\nSome say that this hand gesture has nothing to do with Satanism and is only associated with the University of Texas Longhorn soccer team. But that doesn't explain why the sign is widely and globally used by celebrities, prominent people and non-American celebrities who did not grow up in Texas or attended the University of Texas, or have any sort of affiliation with Texas. Why then are they all doing this hand gesture?\u201d - Les Versets Bibliques. \n\n\u201cKnowing how nothing is exactly what it seems, we need to have a minimum of insight in order to identify those perverted things that have an effect on us on a subconscious level.\n \nIn Kabbalah the tradition is to hide symbols in plain sight while preserving their real significance. Hand signs allow occultists to convey a strong message or a hidden equilibrium. Satanic groups are known to use these hand signs to evoke hidden demonic entities with the purpose of communicating subliminal messages, meant to intimidate, subjugate others to their will or to cast spells and magical chaos. Satanic Hand gestures are also a method of affirming that one belongs to a particular satanic group, and their way of telling Satan they love him.\n\nThe devil's horns hand gesture is known by several names, including: the horns sign, El Diablo, the sign of Satan the horned god, goat horns, Rock On, Rock Fist, Mano Cornuto, Il Cornuto, Pommesgabel, Evil Fingers, metal horns, sign of the devil\u2026 The devil's horns are one of the most widely recognized symbols of", "ocr": "", "image": ["src/hmama/train/reddit_images\\1nnqte6.jpg"], "label": 0}

Look into his history \u2014 from the military school days to the business bailouts \u2014 it\u2019s clear someone was always making sure he stayed relevant.\n\nHere\u2019s the weird part: it\u2019s been documented multiple times that Trump can\u2019t really read properly. (Seriously, look it up. There are countless clips of him stumbling over basic text.) That\u2019s not just a quirk \u2014 that\u2019s by design.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to build a figurehead for a frustrated population, you don\u2019t pick a polished intellectual. You pick someone who reflects the voters you\u2019re targeting \u2014 not too polished, not too \u201celite.\u201d By making sure he never developed normal reading skills, they crafted someone who communicates simply, repeats himself, and sounds like the \u201caverage guy.\u201d That makes him subconsciously more relatable to the demographic they want to energize.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about left vs. right \u2014 it\u2019s about control. He was groomed to be exactly what he is: a character that fires up the base, keeps people distracted, and divides the public just enough to stop them from asking who really benefits.\n\nThoughts? Has anyone else noticed how convenient this all is?", "ocr": "", "image": ["src/hmama/train/reddit_images\\1nnjpk0.jpg"], "label": 0}

So posting for the first time in this group, so little nervous. \n\nThe thing is this particular conspiracy theory (which is more or less have become a mainstream theory now) in India. But of course it's implication is all over the world specially in today's time. \n\nThe context is very complicated, so hard to explain in a short post. But for people with general idea, here is a the context. The Indian independence movement was not just led by Gandhi. In fact, Gandhi had \"minimal\" role in India's independence movement. His faction is often referred to as \"soft faction\" because he wanted to fight British through Non Violent means. \n\nThere was another hard core faction which fought with arms against the British during the 2nd World war. Since \"Enemy's enemy is friend\" that faction was supported by those who ultimately lost the second world war. But nonetheless, the British had to leave India because the military that used to support the British started revolting against them and hence they had to leave India in hurry. \n\nNow the leader of this hard faction was a political figure called Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. In fact he has become very popular in recent times because Indian Prime Minister raised his statue in own of the most important place of New Delhi. The Central square which used to be called King's Way in olden days. \n\nNow the mystery is, that officially this man was declared dead in 1945 in an air craft accident in the then Formosa (today Taiwan). But of course people believe he didn't die. He just created an illusion of his death to trick the British who were searching for him. He lived till ripe old age of 88 years old and died in 1985. \n\nPeople often say that he was present in the Paris Peace Accord 1973 between America and Vietnam. He was their as an advisor to the Vietnamese delegation. This theory has never been proven but there are manhy legit reasons why people who think that. \nThe photo you see above, they say that the guy in the extreme right standing behind with round face is him. \nThe funny thing is through historical records people can map every person in that photo except this individual. Interesting right?? \n\nIf anyone in this group has any knowledge, they can comment or reach out to me because I am very interested in this case because of some quite personal connection. Yes I live in France. I would really appreciate if someone can help identify this person standing in the extreme right.", "ocr": "", "image": ["src/hmama/train/reddit_images\\1nn2js0.jpg"], "label": 0}
